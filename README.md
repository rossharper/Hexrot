# Hexrot

An hexagonal Android experiment. In progress. Playing with some ideas. They may be terrible.

TODO:

- implement AndroidSodaDetailsScreenDisplayEventFactory to actually display the screen

- need to split out providers and fetchers. Make them hexagonal
- UNIT TEST SOME OF THIS!
- upgrade to latest API level
- use pull down swipe refresh list

- look into better thread handling
- list item view holder
- list item view class?
