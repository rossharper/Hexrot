# Hexrot

An hexagonal Android experiment. In progress. Playing with some ideas. They may be terrible.

Warning: hacks are abundant.

TODO:

- backstack for second screen

- need to split out providers and fetchers. Make them hexagonal
- UNIT TEST SOME OF THIS!
- upgrade to latest API level
- use pull down swipe refresh list

- look into better thread handling
- list item view holder
- list item view class?

- what about rotation - does my method of newing fragments introduce configuration change problems?
