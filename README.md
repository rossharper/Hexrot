# Hexrot

An hexagonal Android experiment. In progress. Playing with some ideas. They may be terrible.

Warning: hacks are abundant.

There are zero unit tests, mainly because this is a hacking playground for trying out some ideas.
I should write some really.

TODO:

- continue list abstraction (CollectionView) refactor to RecyclerView
- UNIT TEST MORE OF THIS!
- use pull down swipe refresh list

- look into better thread handling

- what about rotation - does my method of creating fragments introduce configuration change problems?

- list load spinner
- better error message
- network timeout
